    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,composition, and behavior of matter.it is a
        fascinating field that explores the building block of the universe</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>perodic table</mark>is a tabular arrangementof chemical elements.Each element is represented by its
        chemical symbol such as Fe for iron,H for hydrogen ,and O for oxygen.Elements are classified into groups and
        periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <var>chemical reactions.</var>Here's an example of a <var>chemical
            equations:</var></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O <sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O </p>

    <p>This equations represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<dfn>H<sub>2</sub></dfn>) and oxygen gas
        (<dfn>O<sub>2</sub></dfn>) to form water (<dfn>H<sub>2</sub>O</dfn>)</p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculations of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involve balancing chemical
        equations to ensure mass and charges are conserved.<br><br><sub>Subscripts</sub>indicate the number of atoms of
        each element in a molecule,while <sup>superscripts</sup>represents charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us . From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies,chemistry influences avery lives.</p>
